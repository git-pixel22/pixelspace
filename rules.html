  <h2>Below are some rules I have gathered as I went through life, will be adding more soon. These rules are just meant for me. In no condition I'll impose them on anyone else. But feel free to adopt them if you resonate.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Be a lot more kinder to others than you think you should be.</b></li>
    <li><b>No tip toeing.</b></li>
    <li><b>Always do things with heart.</b></li>
    <li><b>Don't try to change people.</b></li>
  </ul>
